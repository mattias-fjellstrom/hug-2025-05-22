# HashiCorp User Group GÃ¶teborg - May 22, 2025

In this demo I set up no-code provisioning modules on HCP Terraform and corresponding resources on HCP Waypoint to allow developer self-service workflows.

## Prerequisites

You need the following:

* Access to an **HCP organization** with the HCP CLI installed ([instructions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/cli/install)). Authenticate to HCP by running `hcp auth login`.
* Access to an **HCP Terraform organization** with **plus tier** license. Authenticate your Terraform CLI to HCP Terraform by running `terraform login`.
* Access to an AWS account with at least one public Route 53 hosted zone. Install the AWS CLI and configure authentication ([instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)).
* A GitHub organization (or personal account) that you have already added as a VCS provider to HCP Terraform, and a GitHub PAT with access to this GitHub organization/account provided in the `github_token` variable.

## How to set up the demo

1. Go to the [prereq](./prereq/) directory and run `terraform init && terraform apply`.
1. Go to the [demo](./demo/) directory and run `terraform init && terraform apply`.

There is currently no support to set up HCP Waypoint agents and agent-based actions with Terraform. To set this up:

1. Go to your HCP organization and to the **hug** project.
1. Go to HCP Waypoint and click on **Agents**.
1. Click on **Create an agent group**.
1. Set the name to **minecraft** and add any description.
1. Go back to HCP Waypoint and click on **Actions**.
1. Click **Create an action**.
1. For each action listed in the table below:
    1. Give the action the name as in the table.
    1. Add variables for the action. For each variable you add to the actions, check the **Enable this value to be defined when the action is triggered. You may optionally enter a default value** tick box.
    1. Select **Agent** as the action type.
    1. Select the **minecraft** agent group.
    1. Provide the name of the action according to the table below in the **Action identifier** field.
    1. Click on **Create action**.

| Name    | Description                            | Variable 1                         | Variable 2                       |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| say     | Say something in the Minecraft world   | `message` (default value `hello!`) |                                  |
| weather | Set the weather in the Minecraft world | `weather` (default value `rain`)   | `duration` (default value `60s`) |
| time    | Set the time in the Minecraft world    | `time` (default value `day`)       |                                  |
| backup  | Export a backup of the server to S3    |                                    |                                  |

When you are done adding the actions, assign each action to the template for the Minecraft server template.

## How to destroy the demo

1. Go to the [demo](./demo/) directory and run `terraform destroy`.
1. Go to the [prereq](./prereq/) directory and run `terraform destroy`.
